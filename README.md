# ELK-stack-training

This project based on ELK stack self-phased training.   
**ELK** stands for Elasticsearch, logstash and Kibana for data visualizaation.    

The ELK Stack helps by providing users with a powerful platform that collects and processes data from multiple data sources, stores that data in one centralized data store that can scale as data grows, and that provides a set of tools to analyze the data.
